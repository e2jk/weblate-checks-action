# scripts/ship.sh — land your local work on main.
#
# Rebases the current branch onto the latest origin/main — any commits from
# a previous round that already landed there are dropped automatically (git
# recognizes their patch is already applied and skips them; this is the same
# mechanism `git pull --rebase` relies on) — then pushes to the `ship`
# branch. That push triggers .github/workflows/auto-pr-merge.yml, which
# opens (or reuses) a PR to main and enables auto-merge: it lands on its own
# once CI is green, no waiting around and no separate manual sync needed
# before your next round of commits — just run this script again.
#
# This is for the repo owner's own solo commits only — external
# contributors should keep using the normal GitHub fork-and-PR flow
# straight into main (see CONTRIBUTING.md), which this script has no part
# in and doesn't affect.
#
# Usage: scripts/ship.sh [--no-verify]
#   --no-verify   skip the pre-push hook (ruff/mypy/bandit/zizmor/
#                 actionlint/pip-audit/tests) — same flag, same meaning as
#                 `git push --no-verify`, just passed straight through.

# add. Checked before rebasing (and against pre-rebase HEAD) since nothing
# about that conclusion depends on rebasing onto origin/main first.

# with "No commits between main and ship" — a confusing failure for a
